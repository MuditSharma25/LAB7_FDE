# üß© **Lab 7 ‚Äì Graph Database Modeling & Querying with Neo4j**

### üß† Overview

This lab demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Graph Database** using **Neo4j** for an e-commerce platform named **ShopSmart**.
The goal is to represent real-world entities such as **Users**, **Products**, **Categories**, **Brands**, and **Reviews** as connected graph nodes, with relationships like **BOUGHT**, **VIEWED**, **RATED**, and **BELONGS_TO** linking them together.

By applying **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and **analytical queries** in **Cypher Query Language**, the project showcases how graph databases can effectively capture complex relationships, user interactions, and recommendation patterns in a dynamic marketplace.

### üß± **Implementation Phases**

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Setup & Configuration**

* Install Neo4j Desktop on your system.
* Create a new database instance named **ShopSmart**.
* Start the instance and access it via the **Neo4j Browser interface**.

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Graph Modeling**

* Define the core entities (nodes): `User`, `Product`, `Category`, `Brand`, and `Review`.
* Establish key relationships: `BOUGHT`, `VIEWED`, `RATED`, `BELONGS_TO`, `MADE_BY`, and others.
* Verify the data structure and visualize the graph connections.

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 3: Querying the Graph**

* Retrieve specific nodes and relationships using `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `RETURN`, and `WITH`.
* Analyze user behavior, product associations, and review details through Cypher queries.

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 4: Data Updates**

* Modify existing nodes and relationships using commands like `SET`, `MERGE`, and `REMOVE`.
* Introduce new relationships or update attributes to reflect recent interactions.

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 5: Data Deletion**

* Safely remove nodes or relationships using `DELETE` and `DETACH DELETE` while maintaining graph integrity.

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 6: Advanced Analytics**

* Execute analytical queries using functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()` to derive insights on:

  * Top users and products
  * Category performance
  * Product recommendation patterns
